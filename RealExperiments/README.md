This repository contains a Benchmark for evaluating Evolutionary Computation approaches to Curriculum Sequencing problem.

LOM folder contains six other folders (six computer areas of study) that can be considered as courses. In these folders there are several files, in IEEE-LOM standard, that describe Learning Objects. However, all these areas together may be considered a big course like Computer Introdution. The most important information about the learning objects is described in Educational tag: Typical Learning Time, Interactivity Type, Interactivity Level, Difficulty, Learning Resource Type, among others.

These learning objects together cover a total of 30 learning concepts.
