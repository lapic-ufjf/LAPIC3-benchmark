# LAPIC3-benchmark

This repository contains a testbed containing metadata from real learning materials. This learning materials cover a Computer Introduction course.

LOM folder contains six other folders (six computer fields of study) that can be considered as courses. In these folders there are several files -- in IEEE-LOM standard -- that describe Learning Objects. However, all these fields together may be considered a big course of Computer Introduction. 

The most important information about the learning objects is described in Educational tag: Typical Learning Time, Interactivity Type, Interactivity Level, Difficulty, Learning Resource Type, among others.

These learning objects together cover 30 learning concepts.
